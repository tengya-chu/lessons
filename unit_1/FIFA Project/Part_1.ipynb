    "**Link to repo: https://github.com/ironhack-edu/data_project_FIFA_21**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the fifa21_trainning.csv dataset provided to predict the position ('OVA') of each player. The competition will take place from monday morning to tuesday. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Your model will be saved in a pickle file.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The ranking of the competitors will be calculated according to the highest Mean Average Error (MAE), rounded to 2 decimals.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Ties will be broken using, respectively: R2 Score (rounded to 2 decimals), Root Mean Squared Error (rounded to 2 decimals), time to run the code (using timeit)\n",

    "## DELIVERABLES:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your group should deliver a `group Jupyter notebook` with all the preprocessing functions alongside with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything must be delivered until 12am on Tuesday. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Be prepared to share your work on Tuesday morning, the best scores will have the opportunity to show their notebook and go through their pipeline (~10 min).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To deliver:\n",
    "* A notebook with your work and model (group_number.ipynb);\n",
    "* Pickle file with the model (group_number.pkl). \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The instructor will use your `group Jupyter notebook` to load a new dataset and use your functions and\n",
    "your model to make a prediction in unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this small project you are going to work in groups to put in practice some of the concepts of the previous week.\n",
    "\n",
    "With your group mates, open the file in `file_for_project/fifa21_training.csv`. The objective is to create the best linear model to predict the column `OVA`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find some documentation about the meaning of each column in the following links:\n",

    "### 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Each member of the team should have his/her own _juypter_ notebook. In addition, each group should have a `group jupyter notebook`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide which columns can be predictive and which ones can be directly dropped and take the needed actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Decide among the members of the group who is going to take care of inspecting the remaining columns\n",
    "of the dataset. For example:\n",
    "Member 1: cols 1 -> 5\n",
    "Member 2: cols 6 -> 10\n",
    "...\n",
    "and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Each member must do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore their assigned columns and write python code to perform any cleanup operation that the assigned columns may need.\n",
    "- Perform any scaling operation that the assigned column may need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Put all the code of each member into the `group jupyter notebook`."
