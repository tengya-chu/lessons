    "### Lesson Duration: 3 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "> Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to introduce more PowerBI visual features \n",
    "including _creating bins_, _donut charts_, _cards_, \n",
    "adding more than one visual to a single page and using filters across plots on the page. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create bins from numerical columns \n",
    "- Aggregate appropriate values into tooltips and cards\n",
    "- Set up filters which operate across visuals on a single report\n",
    "- Use drill-throughs to arrive at business insights\n",
    "- Feel confident with the formatting options to construct a single usable report summary page in PowerBI \n",
    "- Familiarize yourself to the project and methodology which you will be working on next\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: you will have to choose a project (out of the two choices available) by the end of the lesson.\n",
    "If we end this lesson soon, you can also start working on the project. For the  final project, you will be able to choose a topic of your own choice. \n",
    "You should choose a project where you can showcase your skills well, learned during the bootcamp.\n",

    "1. choose donut chart visualization type \n",
    "2. process step on legend, distinct count of visitor id or client id on values (NOTE, do not use visit id - this will include multiple visits in one confirmation process)\n",
    "3. this plot should be adjusted to fill half of the page- and then a second donut chart created with the same contents will take up the other half \n",
    "4. filter one plot to variation = Test, the other to variation = Control \n",
    "5. you can hide the legend on the second plot, but add the titles to reflect the variation selected on each plot \n",
    "6. on the tooltips - drop average balance and distinct count of clients \n",
    "7. verify the tooltips and plots visually \n",

    "    - How many clients fall under each Client_rating and what is the average Customer Lifetime Value of each rating group? \n",
    "    - Show average total claim by client rating and is there a contrast between number of clients in rating and total claim amount? \n",
    "3. Include a chart on a different topic: on the same report page create a chart (Tip: Use a matrix (crosstab) or map) showing those clients with only a High school diploma or below and who have a customer lifetime value greater than 2000. How many clients fall in this category and which States are they from ? \n",
    "4. Use the card feature to show the total number of clients on the same report page and tidy up your report to remove any visual clutter,  edit and format chart titles so that the report is easy to use and navigate. \n",
    "5. Test your report to ensure expected interactivity works - ideally the summary card will update when you click on the other charts. \n"
