# Case Study: A Fund Raising Net Return Prediction Model - "Healthcare for All"

### Scenario

_(This is the same as week 1.)_

The "Healthcare for All" is a not-for-profit organization that provides financial help to people with who are not able to afford healthcare. “Healthcare for All” raises funds through donations from all across the country. They have an in-house database of over 13 million donors. "Healthcare for All" has been consistently raising money through various campaigns to request people to contribute to their cause. They reach out to the donors through various channels including personal mails, emails, fund raising events, reaching out to other businesses and corporations, and other philanthropists. They have sent their donors with some gift amounts with the promotions mails.

You are working for "Healthcare for All" as an analyst. You will be analyzing the results of one of their recent direct mail fund raising appeals.

### Objective

With this case study, the senior management wants to analyze their gifting patterns. As mentioned before, the company has been sending gift amounts to their donors along with the promotions mails. They want to augment/optimize their operations by using some AI/machine learning in the process of deciding the right amount of gifting amount to the prospective customers based on some data that they have collected over the years.

### Tasks

Your task as a data analyst is to help improving the process by developing machine learning models to predict the gift amount based on X features. Follow the data analysis workflow to build the model.

- 3rd byte: Amount of Giving
  L=Less than $100(Low Dollar)

  U=Urban
  C=City
  S=Suburban

- 2nd byte = Socio-Economic status of the neighborhood
