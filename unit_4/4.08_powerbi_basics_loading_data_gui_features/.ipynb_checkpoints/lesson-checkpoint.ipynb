    "- Navigate around the PowerBI interface confidently \n",
    "- Differentiate: report, data, model view\n",
    "- Awareness of possible transformation steps and how to add/ remove / reorder steps \n",
    "- When and how to use powerquery features\n",
    "- Get more data and detect relationships between tables\n",
    "- How to apply filters to reports\n",
    "- Edit and add more details to the visualizations\n",
    "- Work with aggregation types\n",

    "  - 3 views (navigate from top left) - report, data, model\n",

    "  - Delete the latest step, revert this delete by closing transformation menu and discarding changes\n",
    "  - Add a new transformation step - change DateTime column to datetime data type by clicking on the data type icon above the DateTime column. Note the transform step resulted in errors on a large number of rows.\n",
    "  - This happens because the dates are US locale formatting ie M/D/YY not D/M/YY. Remove this step because it causes errors\n",
    "  - Click on the data type symbol to see the options again - select the **Using locale...** option\n",
    "  - Select data type date/time and locale english(united states) to find the data format match\n",
    "  - After creating the step, rename it appropriately and ensure it is the last step of the transformations (show how to reorder and discuss with class the impact of moving this one to an earlier step- wider concept of **dependencies up / downstream**)\n",
    "  - Draw attention the query window for that step\n",
    "  - add one more transformation step - client age to whole number - and rename that step\n",
    "  - use this opportunity to explore the transformation options and Q&A with class - why to use these options and when ? \n",
    "  - class q&a - why is it helpful to rename the transformations? \n",

    "    - Marital status by number of policies \n",
