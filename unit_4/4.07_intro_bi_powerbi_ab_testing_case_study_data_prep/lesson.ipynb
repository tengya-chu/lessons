    "\n",
    "### Lesson Duration: 3 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "> Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to introduce business intelligence and business intelligence tool _PowerBI_ to the students. The accent is also on emphasizing that business knowledge is critical for business analysts/data analysts. We will also talk about `KPI`s and metrics. Also, we will explain the business case study (`A/B Testing`) for PowerBI.\n",

    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "- All previous installation\n",
    "- PowerBI installation (book at least 10-15 min of the class to make sure everyone has it, attendees will have completed an optional install PowerBI lab prior to this lesson) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain what is business intelligence/business analysis\n",
    "- Define and design some `KPI`s and metrics for business success tracking\n",
    "- Interpret the use and benefits of `A/B Testing` to make more informed product design decisions\n",
    "- Use PowerBI as a BI Tool to get more insights as a team. That includes:\n",
    "  - Connect PowerBI with different data sources\n",
    "  - Perform transformation steps on the data with PowerBI (+ power query)\n",
    "  - Navigate the PowerBI interface with confidence\n",
    "  - Explore the different features available in PowerBI and choose them according to the project needs\n",

    "**Description: Intro to BI**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Intelligence** is an application of data analysis that aids companies in making data-driven decisions. Using Business Intelligence technologies, we can provide insights into the performance of a business in the past and the present as well as make predictions or recommendations for the future. A key difference between Business Intelligence and data analysis is those insights are meant to be actionable and geared towards helping a business make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description: BI Tools**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Intelligence tools are designed to make sense of the huge quantities of data that organizations accumulate over time. The BI tools analyze this information and present it as actionable information that can guide decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Business Intelligence software makes up a large heterogeneous category of software. Not all tools in the category can be meaningfully compared to each other. There are several types of BI tools of which the most substantive are the _Full-Stack Business Intelligence Tools_ and _Data Visualization Tools_.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Some examples:\n",
    "  - Tableau\n",
    "  - Power BI\n",
    "  - SAP Business Intelligence\n",
    "  - Domo\n",
    "  - IBM cognos analytics\n",
    "  - Qliksense\n",

    "\n",
    "**Description: KPIs and Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **metric** is a quantifiable measure that provides us with information about how well a company is doing at achieving its business objectives. Since companies can only improve the things they measure, it is a crucial part of an analyst's job to use the most appropriate metrics. Many companies like to use the term `KPI` (Key Performance Indicator) interchangeably with metrics. An example of a metric is the amount of money spent per sale or the percent of customers that buy a product out of all customers visiting the site."

The application is familiar to users of Microsoft Excel, which makes it easy to connect to data sources, create plots, and perform basic analysis tasks to discover insights which can be shared within an organization. In this lesson, we will learn about the different features of PowerBI and how it can be a valuable addition to your analytics toolkit. We will also cover how to load data into PowerBI- and what kinds of data sources can be connected.\n",

    "\n",
    "- _Data Transformations_: Using a familiar excel interface end users can create multi source data models and apply transformations, including calculated columns, aggregations, pivoting, even exploiting DAX language to create complex functions. \n",
    "- _Variety of Visualizations Types_: PowerBI has several types of visualizations you can use - from bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots to area charts, bubble charts, treemaps. Speaking of maps, it also allows you to visualize your data geographically.\n",
    "- _Report Sharing_: You can combine several visualizations into reports, add commentary and with PowerBI enterprise tools, create dashboards to share the insights. Everyone with an office 365 account can utilize PowerBI desktop at no additional cost, allowing them to develop and share filterable workbooks with colleagues.  \n",
