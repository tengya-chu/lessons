For example, there is a model with 10 variables and the other model has 20 variables. The model with 20 variables will give a larger R square but does that really mean that this model is better than the other model. We can't say it for sure. For this, we use adjusted the `r` square.\n",

In fact, **R2** is a **biased** estimator (more information [here](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/r-squared-too-high/#:~:text=Reason%201%3A%20R-squared%20is%20a%20biased%20estimate&text=In%20statistics%2C%20a%20biased%20estimator,use%20adjusted%20R2%20instead).\n",
