    "\n",
    "> Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to make students aware of the different data sources that data analysts come across, how to write simple queries in SQL, and extract information from SQL databases. Students will also be introduced to a different case study (case study related to the _Banking_) that we will be using during this week and the following weeks for SQL.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Identify the different tools/technologies for storing and manipulating structured and unstructured data\n",
    "- Explain the difference between database and data warehouse\n",
    "- Connect to a SQL database and write simple queries in SQL to extract relevant information\n",

    "\n",
    "- _Simple data storage model_: The structure in which data is stored in a relational database is simple, with information stored in tables that are linked to each other. There is no hierarchy in the tables.\n",
    "- _No data redundancy / Normalized tables_: Data is stored just once, eliminating data duplication. This is accomplished with the use of primary and foreign keys. (we will discuss this in the later lessons).\n",
    "- Large amounts of data can be stored in databases as compared to spreadsheets.\n",
    "- _Standardized Language_: There are tools that can be used by relational databases for querying large amounts of data, quickly and reliably. SQL provides a uniform platform worldwide to all its users. A large amount of data is retrieved quickly and efficiently. Operations, like insert, delete, manipulation of data are also done in almost no time."
