    "\n",
    "> Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to familiarize students with some of the database design principles including _entities_, _attributes_, _relationships_, as well as with the _entity relationship diagrams_. The students will also learn about different kinds of SQL commands (_DDL_, _DML_, _DCL_, and _TCL_). We will then use some simple _DDL_ commands to:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - create a table,\n",
    "    - alter the properties of a table, and\n",
    "    - populate the table with new data.\n",

    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lesson, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpret entity-relationship diagram\n",
    "- Interpret primary keys and foreign keys, and introduce normalization\n",
    "- Distinguish between different SQL commands as DML, DDL, DCL, and TCL\n",

    "- _Foreign_ keys and why we need them\n",
    "\n",
    "  Foreign keys are used to create a link between two tables so that we do not repeat the same information in multiple tables. This is crucial for a very important database design principle called \"normalization\". This helps in eliminating data redundancy in the database.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you compare the two images, you can see the amount of redundant information. If you imagine this in a database that has a large number of such tables and thousands of rows, it can lead to extremely inefficient storage of information. **Hence, the foreign keys are used to reference data from another table, to establish that link wherever necessary.**"

    "In this lab, you will be using the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database of movie rentals. You have been using this database for a couple labs already, but if you need to get the data again, refer to the official [installation link](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The database is structured as follows:\n",

    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drop column `picture` from `staff`.\n",
    "2. A new person is hired to help Jon. Her name is TAMMY SANDERS, and she is a customer. Update the database accordingly.\n",
    "3. Add rental for movie \"Academy Dinosaur\" by Charlotte Hunter from Mike Hillyer at Store 1. You can use current date for the `rental_date` column in the `rental` table.\n",
    "   **Hint**: Check the columns in the table rental and see what information you would need to add there. You can query those pieces of information. For eg., you would notice that you need `customer_id` information as well. To get that you can use the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    select customer_id from sakila.customer\n",
    "    where first_name = 'CHARLOTTE' and last_name = 'HUNTER';\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Use similar method to get `inventory_id`, `film_id`, and `staff_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Delete non-active users, but first, create a _backup table_ `deleted_users` to store `customer_id`, `email`, and the `date` for the users that would be deleted. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Check if there are any non-active users\n",
    "   - Create a table _backup table_ as suggested\n",
    "   - Insert the non active users in the table _backup table_\n",
    "   - Delete the non active users from the table _customer_"
