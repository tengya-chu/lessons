    "> Purpose: The purpose of this lesson is to proceed with learning basic SQL queries, combined with other operators including `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `REGEXP`(regular expressions), and `DISTINCT` keyword. We will also take a look at more examples focusing on the five main clauses of the `SELECT` statement, which includes `select`, `from`, `where`, `order by`, and `limit`, along with the applications of some operators and expressions we have looked at so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: An expression is a combination of columns and operators that evaluate to a single value. In the select clause, you can code an expression with one or more operators and functions.\n",
