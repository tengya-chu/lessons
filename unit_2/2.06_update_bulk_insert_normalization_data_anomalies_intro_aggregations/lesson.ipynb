    "\n",
    "- Normalization is the process of efficiently organizing data in the database. It is used to **reduce redundancy** and **improve data integrity**. Redundant data is the unnecessary reoccurring data in the database (repeating groups of data) whereas data integrity ensures the quality of data in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The database designer should structure the data in such a way that eliminates unnecessary duplication(s) and provides a faster search path to all necessary information. This process of specifying and defining tables, keys, columns, and relationships to create an efficient database is called _normalization_.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the database is not correctly normalized, it can result in the following issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - Redundant data/repetition of information\n",
    "      - Inability to represent certain information\n",
    "      - Difficulty to maintain information/data anomalies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Not only does data redundancy cause the waste of computer space, but data redundancy also causes data anomalies such as insertion anomaly, deletion anomaly, and update anomaly. We will talk about it in the next session more.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Normalization Forms\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are different normalization forms, which represent the degree to which a database table has been normalized. The higher the form, the better it is. Here are some normalization forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "      - 1NF: First normal form\n",
    "      - 2NF: Second normal form\n",

Because this is a new Pharmacy and there is no prescription filled by the Pharmacy yet, there are no data of prescriptions for this pharmacy. We can give only the NULL value for the `PrescriptionID`, `MedicineID`, `MedicineName`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `LastPickupDate`, and `RefillFrequency` attributes of the `PrescriptionFilling` relation. However, `PrescriptionID` and `MedicineID` are the primary keys and can't have the NULL value. Hence, we can't add a new record for this new pharmacy to the `PrescriptionFilling` relation because we don't have a specific value for the primary key of this new record.\n",
