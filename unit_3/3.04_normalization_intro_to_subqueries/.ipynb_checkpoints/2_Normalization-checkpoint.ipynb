    "Normalization is performed based on the analysis of functional dependencies that are present in a relation. Given that A and B are two sets of attributes, B functionally depends on A, or in other terms, A determines B, if a given value of A uniquely determines the value of B. The functional dependency of B on A is denoted as `A → B` or represented using a dependency diagram as shown in the figure below. A is called \"determinant(s)\" and B is called \"dependent(s)\".\n",

    "In the `PrescriptionFilling` relation, since `PrescriptionID` and `MedicineID` are the primary keys of the `PrescriptionFilling` relation, a given value of the primary key uniquely identifies one record of the relation. Hence, we have the following functional dependency:\n",
    "`PrescriptionID, MedicineID → PharmacyID, PharmacyName, Address, Phone, MedicineName, Description, Quantity, LastPickupDate, and RefillFrequency`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any relation, this always is a functional dependency that has the primary key attribute(s) as the determinant(s) and the non-key attribute(s) as the dependents. In addition to the functional dependency with the primary key as the determinant(s), we identify the functional dependencies that have a smaller number of determinants than that in the functional dependency with the primary key as the determinant(s).\n",

    "The only functional dependency that should be present in a relation is the functional dependency with the primary key as the determinant and all the non-key attributes as the dependents.

If multiple functional dependencies are identified in a relation, normalization needs to be performed on the relation to remove the functional dependencies other than the one with the primary key as the determinant(s) and all the non-key attributes as the dependents and thus bring the relation to a normal form without data redundancy and data anomalies\n",

The `Medicine` relation does not have any transitive functional dependency. Hence, the `Medicine` relation is in `3NF`.\n",
    "The `PrescriptionFilling` relation has two functional dependencies. The `PrescriptionFilling` relation is in `2NF`. Because the `PrescriptionFilling` relation has a transitive functional dependency, `FD2`, the `PrescriptionFilling` relation is not in `3NF`.
